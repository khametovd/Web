                    from 1999-2006[2] and was replaced by the BMW E70. The E53 was developed at a time when BMW
                    still owned Land Rover and as such shares many components and designs with both the Land Rover Range
                    Rover L322 model (specifically the Hill Descent System and Off Road Engine Management system) and
                    the BMW E39 5 Series (specifically engines and electronic systems). The entire in-car entertainment
                    system (Radio Function, Navigation System, Television and Telecommunications systems) are shared
	                    with other BMWs and L322.</p>

                    sport utility vehicle produced by the German manufacturer Porsche since 2002, with North American
                    sales beginning in 2003. It is the first V8-engined vehicle built by Porsche since 1995, when the
                    Porsche 928 was discontinued. It is also Porsche's first off road variant vehicle since its Super
                    and Junior tractors of 1950s, and the first Porsche with four doors. Since 2008, all engines have
                    featured direct injection technology.</p>
